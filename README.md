# Stringbyte

### Description
Stringbyte is a Module for Roblox which simplifies creating strings and manage tags

## Installation
First of all select the Latest [``Stringbyte``](https://www.roblox.com/library/9998442298) version. After you click on that, download the
[``Stringbyte.rbxm``](https://github.com/TriumvirateStudios/Stringbyte/releases/download/Stable/Stringbyte.rbxm). Once it's done drag and drop the file to Roblox Studio

### Another method

Open the toolbar in Roblox and search ``'Stringbyte'`` then you'll see a model called ``Stringbyte Module`` but
make sure it's made by @TriumvariteStudios then put it in ServerScriptService.

## Usage

### Creating a String
First of all we need to insert a script to `ServerScriptService` then require the script so that
the Module can start

```lua
local Stringbyte = require(game:GetService("ServerScriptService").Stringbyte.MainModule)
```
